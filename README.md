Encapsulation is a programming concept that refers to the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit, or object. Encapsulation helps to reduce complexity by compartmentalizing and abstracting certain elements of an application, making it easier to understand and maintain.

Abstraction is a technique that involves focusing on essential features of an object and ignoring others. It allows us to work with complex systems by hiding unnecessary details and exposing only the relevant information. By abstracting certain elements of an application, we can make it easier to understand and use.

Inheritance is a feature of object-oriented programming languages that allows one class to inherit the characteristics of another class. This means that a subclass can inherit attributes and behaviors from a superclass, which can help to reduce the amount of code that needsto be written and maintained. Inheritance can also facilitate code reuse and improve the organization of an application.

Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on multiple forms. In object-oriented programming, this means that a single object can be used to perform different tasks depending on the context in which it is used. Polymorphism allows us to write more flexible and adaptable code, as we can create objects that can be used in a variety of different situations.
